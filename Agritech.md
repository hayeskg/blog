# Regenerative agriculture 
## and how technology can provide new tools in adopting it quicker

## Farming as usual

Over the last year we have been able to truly appreciate the scale and complexity of our global food systems. Food security and resilience was pushed to the forefront of our collective minds - a fundamental, instinctive need to feed ourselves manifested itself in supermarket queues and stock-piling early on in the Covid-19 crisis. 

Communities that are closer to the people and natural environments which provide sustenance are not only more resilient to the disruption of international supply chains but have stronger relationships locally that allow them to adapt to uncertainty in an agile way. Producers who already communicate regularly with their customer base have the infrastructure in place to respond to changes to their supply chains and reorganise quickly through effective communication and collaboration. 

As we start to see the slow emergence of our societies from a period of social and physical isolation, many are re-evaluating aspects of our society and economy - people want to **rethink** and **reimagine** instead of returning to **business as usual**. It's simply clear that we cannot continue on a path of infinite growth on a planet with finite resources.

In agricultural systems too, this shift in approach is long overdue. Industrialised food production has evolved over the last century to incentivise productivity and cost saving over environmental protection and biodiveristy. As supply chains become longer and more integrated with large corporate players, the industry focuses on the wrong things - short-term gains over resilience and quality. Producers are being put in the unfair position of choosing between the economic viabiity of their business (and ultimately staying afloat) and their fundamental role of guardians and managers of our natural environment. 

A global shock, like the Covid 19 pandemic was a fantastic opportunity to illustrate to many the precarious nature of our food systems. Supermarkets who operated just-in-time stock with international logistics were days away from empty shelves. Resilience in our food systems suddenly took on a very new meaning - illustrated by how disconnected we are from our food and the people who produce it.

It's a relatively recent development that food is being produced, transported, bought and consumed the way it is today. Technological advancements with new economic models and consumer behaviour in the 20th centry are partly behind this shift and so is agricultural policy.

Insutrial farming techniques - heavy mechanisation, chemical inputs such as fertilisers and pesticides and vast monocultures have been applied to eek out increasingly slim profit margins from crops that will ultimately compete on international markets. Meanwhile policies failed to prioritise soil health and biodiversity as an economic factor. We are now seeing soils depleted with the existing toolkit of chemical inputs no longer working - certainly not from a biodiversity perspective. There is now a recognition that a loss of vibrant ecosystems above and below ground has a direct economic impact on productivity and resilience of our food systems. It follows then, that even the most cynical, profit-oriented corporation needs to start engaging with the reversal of some of the damaging trends of the last century. According to the UNs FAO agency, we only have 60 harvests left in our global soils if we continue at this rate (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-food-soil-farming-idUSKCN0JJ1R920141205). 

## What is regenerative agriculture? 

In short it's all about soil health and building up soils instead of degrading them. Healthy soils are full of life and biodiversity. A healthy mix of nutrients, bacterial life, fungi, micro-organisms, insects and of course plant roots themselves. This hugely complex interaction of biological systems are responsible for converting light and atmospheric gasses into soil nutrients through photosynthesis and a carbon cycle. Atmospheric carbon drawn down into soils can be stored there, helping fertility, soil structure and moisture management. 

The strange thing is that there is nothing revolutionary about these principles. Natural ecosystems have worked in balance for millenia, long before humans started cultivating land for their own use. Through tilling the land, we have systematically broken up sub-surface networks of nutrients, structure and moisture - resulting in loss of fertility and erosion. Tilled land also releases soil carbon, making industrial agriculture a net emitter of carbon and a contributor to global warming.

But what if we could transition back towards these practices in agriculture? There is a huge potential to rapidly start sequestering huge amounts of carbon into our soils with so many benefits. Healthy soils mean healthy and abundant food, better human and animal health and ultimately a healthier and more resilient planet. Given the neccesity to act now on climate change, widely adopting such a fundamental, ultimately simple tool in reversing the carbon cycle, we can transform the biodiversity of our planet and the resilience and quality of our food systems all at once.

## A climate perspective

Systematic depletion of soils is not only a food resilience and biodiversity issue. Global carbon emissions from agriculture continue to rise. We are all too aware of the urgent and radical need to curb our global emissions to manageable levels - as recognised by the Paris Agreement and the countries who have signed up to the pledge. 

Yet there is a huge opporunity in shifting our priorities from a purely output focused treatement of soils to one that recognises it's carbon capture properties. Healthy soils, natural ecosystems are incredibly effective at sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. As clever technocrats debate new energy and resource intensive industrial schemes to suck carbon from our atmosphere, the solution has been beneath our feet for all this time. 

An ecosystem of living, varied organisms below and above the ground has huge benefits. Not only does it improve soil nutrient levels, structure and biodiversity it also speeds up chemical processes which ultimately boost the carbon cycle, storing atmospheric carbon in our soils.

This shift in perspective in agriculture has a positive knock-on effect for our climate issues. This integrated view is what makes this a particularly effective climate solution in my view. Another is the scale and speed at which these 'back to basics' techniques can be applied globally and to a range of farming businesses. 

So what next once we recognise the need for action to shift in this direction?

## Policy must drive change

Governments worldwide are building future farming visions increasingly around the protection and regeneration of our natural environment. DEFRA in the UK is launching the Sustainable Farming Incentive from 2022 (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/farmers-invited-to-take-first-step-towards-greener-future) and the European Commissions puts a sustainable food system at the heart of the European Green Deal, through incentives such as the Organic Action Plan which aims to bring 25% of land under organic farming (https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/farming/organic-farming/organic-action-plan_en). Subsidies and financial incentives for farmers will increasingly be linked to the application of regenrative, agro-ecological practices instead of the net area under management.

Similar trends are happening in the US and Australia with Regenerative Agriculture being championed by research institutes and farmers alike.

## Quantifying progress

As a new vision for resiliant food systems emerge in policy they will make their way into practice over the coming decades. Regulators, growers, financiers and other stakeholders will need to start measuring progress - once the right metrics for progress have been established. 

This is where I see the opportunity for technology to play a new and significant role in this new landscape. If subsidies are linked to soil and crop health, evidence is needed to support payments. In an increasingly digitalised economy, the currency is relevant, granular data across new frameworks that are emerging. 

Soil health and condition monitoring is a good place to start. By developing automated and autonomous systems which can provide accurate and up to date data on how soils health is improving will provide farmers with the hard evidence of their efforts and give confidence to backers - governmental or free market - about the impact. 

Measuring soils nutrients, microorganisms, the carbon sequestered are all interesting metrics and there is an opportunity to start applying technologies that have transformed other parts of our economy to our fields. Web technologies, IoT connectivity, robotics and data analysis are all important areas that are being adapted support agricultural markets. 

Developing these technologies requires strong and focused financial and innovation frameworks, to mitigate risks and make the long-term investment in terms of time, effort and resources. 

## Innovation pipeline

There are many pitfalls and risks associated with developing technologies for new markets and sometimes this brings with it a certain *hype* element which is not necessarily helpful. 


A huge impact area is the ability to store carbon in our soils through vibrant, abundant ecosystems. There are major benefits to scaling this approach: 
- **It already exists!** 
Natural systems are there to convert atmospheric carbon into soil nutrients through complex chemical processes
- **Available at scale!**
Farmland already takes up a vast amount of our global land mass. Turning fields into intensive carbon sequestration plants through relatively low-tech appraches we can start to accelerate towards a net zero economy
- **Fair and diverse**
Small-scale, mixed farms are very effective at producing food outputs - ultimately they have evolved during millenia. Embracing and protecting more traditional or even indigenous land-management practices means we can apply techniques without major disruption or delay. 

My own personal interest however is exploring the role of technology tools and solutions in helping embrace these old/new approaches to producing our food in a sustainable, healthy and profitable way. 

Clearly there is a contradiction between returning to more traditional practices and technological innovation - sometimes not the most sustainable from environmental perspectives.
