# Sustainable agriculture and technology

Over the last year we have been able to truly appreciate the scale of our global food systems. Food security and resilience was pushed to the forefront of our collective minds - a fundamental, instinctive need to feed ourselves manifested itself in supermarket queues and hoarding early on in the Covid-19 crisis. 

Communities that are closer to the people and nature which provides sustenance are not only more resilient to the disruption to international supply chains but have stronger relationships locally that allow them to manage changes in an agile way. Producers who were already communicating weekly offers to their customer base had the infrastructure in place to respond to the shocks through effective communication. 

As we can see the slow emergence of our societies from a period of social and physical isolation, contemplation and reflection we are rethinking many aspects of our society and economy - people want to **rethink** instead of returning to **business as usual**. This rethink of our agricultural systems is long overdue. Industrialised food production has evolved over the last century to incentivise productivity and cost saving over environmental protection. Farmers were put in unfair positions of choosing between the economic viabiity of their business (of feeding people) and their fundamental role of guardians and managers of our natural environments. 

Heavy mechanisation, chemical inputs such as fertilisers and pesticides and moving towards monocultures have been applied to eek out increasingly slim profit margins from crops that will ultimately compete on international markets. Meanwhile policies disregarded soil and biodiversity health as an economic factor. We are now seeing soils depleted with the existing toolkit of chemical inputs no longer effective - partly through the recognition of their environmental burden and subsequent progressive policy being considered by governments around the world. A welcome shift would be to incentivise farmers through subsidies to boost the health of our soils and environment instead of bottom line profit and loss metrics. By building regenrative, agro-ecological practices into our long-term vision for our food systems we will reap the benefits as society. 

A huge impact area is the ability to store carbon in our soils through vibrant, abundant ecosystems. There are major benefits to scaling this approach: 
- **It already exists!** 
Natural systems are there to convert atmospheric carbon into soil nutrients through complex chemical processes
- **Available at scale!**
Farmland already takes up a vast amount of our global land mass. Turning fields into intensive carbon sequestration plants through relatively low-tech appraches we can start to accelerate towards a net zero economy
- **Fair and diverse**
Small-scale, mixed farms are very effective at producing food outputs - ultimately they have evolved during millenia. Embracing and protecting more traditional or even indigenous land-management practices means we can apply techniques without major disruption or delay. 

My own personal interest however is exploring the role of technology tools and solutions in helping embrace these old/new approaches to producing our food in a sustainable, healthy and profitable way. 

Clearly there is a contradiction between returning to more traditional practices and technological innovation - sometimes not the most sustainable from environmental perspectives. 

Areas of agritech: 

- information services - soil, crop health analysis made possible through direct data capture 
- Automation and robotics - automate tasks or tools to complement existing processes
- Decision support tools - spotting trends in the data lanscape, helping us understand our actions and the effects they have on the system
