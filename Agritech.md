# Shifting to regenerative agriculture with technology

## Snapshot of agricultural trends

Over the last year we have been able to truly appreciate the scale and complexity of our global food systems. Food security and resilience was pushed to the forefront of our collective minds - a fundamental, instinctive need to feed ourselves manifested itself in supermarket queues and hoarding early on in the Covid-19 crisis. 

Communities that are closer to the people and nature which provides sustenance are not only more resilient to the disruption to international supply chains but have stronger relationships locally that allow them to manage changes in an agile way. Producers who were already communicating weekly offers to their customer base had the infrastructure in place to respond to shocks to their supply chains and reorganise through effective communication. 

As we start see the slow emergence of our societies from a period of social and physical isolation, many are contemplating aspects of our society and economy - people want to **rethink** instead of returning to **business as usual**. In agricultural systems too, this shift in approach is long overdue. Industrialised food production has evolved over the last century to incentivise productivity and cost saving over environmental protection - as supply chains become longer and more integrated with large corporate players. Farmers were put in unfair positions of choosing between the economic viabiity of their business (and ultimately staying afloat) and their fundamental role of guardians and managers of our natural environment. 

Insutrial farming techniques - heavy mechanisation, chemical inputs such as fertilisers and pesticides and moving towards vast monocultures have been applied to eek out increasingly slim profit margins from crops that will ultimately compete on international markets. Meanwhile policies failed to prioritise soil health and biodiversity as an economic factor. We are now seeing soils depleted with the existing toolkit of chemical inputs no longer sustainable - certainly not from a biodiversity perspective. There is now a recognition that a loss of vibrant ecosystems above and below ground has a direct economic impact on productivity and resilience of our food systems. It follows then, that even the most cynical, profit-oriented corporation needs to start engaging with the reversal of some of the damaging trends of the last century.

Governments worldwide are building future farming visions increasingly around the protection and regeneration of our natural environment. DEFRA in the UK is launching the Sustainable Farming Incentive from 2022 (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/farmers-invited-to-take-first-step-towards-greener-future) and the European Commissions puts a sustainable food system at the heart of the European Green Deal, through incentives such as the Organic Action Plan which aims to bring 25% of land under organic farming (https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/farming/organic-farming/organic-action-plan_en). Subsidies and financial incentives for farmers will increasingly be linked to the application of regenrative, agro-ecological practices instead of the net area under management.

## Quantifying progress

As a new vision for resiliant food systems emerge in policy they will make their way into practice over the coming decades. Regulators, growers, financiers and other stakeholders will need to start measuring progress - once the right metrics for progress have been established. 

This is where I see the opportunity for technology to play a new and significant role in this new landscape. If subsidies are linked to soil and crop health, evidence is needed to support payments. In an increasingly digitalised economy, the currency is relevant, granular data across new frameworks that are emerging. 

Soil health and condition monitoring is a good place to start. My developing automated and autonomous systems which can provide accurate and up to date data on how soils health is improving will provide farmers with the hard evidence of their efforts and give confidence to backers - governmental or free market - about the impact. 

Measuring soils nutrients, microorganisms, the carbon sequestered are all interesting metrics and there is an opportunity to start applying technologies that have transformed other parts of our economy to our fields. Web technologies, IoT connectivity, robotics and data analysis are all important areas that are being adapted support agricultural markets. 

Developing these technologies requires strong and focused financial and innovation frameworks, to mitigate risks and make the long-term investment in terms of time, effort and resources. 

## Innovation pipeline

There are many pitfalls and risks associated with developing technologies for new markets and sometimes this brings with it a certain *hype* element which is not necessarily helpful. 


A huge impact area is the ability to store carbon in our soils through vibrant, abundant ecosystems. There are major benefits to scaling this approach: 
- **It already exists!** 
Natural systems are there to convert atmospheric carbon into soil nutrients through complex chemical processes
- **Available at scale!**
Farmland already takes up a vast amount of our global land mass. Turning fields into intensive carbon sequestration plants through relatively low-tech appraches we can start to accelerate towards a net zero economy
- **Fair and diverse**
Small-scale, mixed farms are very effective at producing food outputs - ultimately they have evolved during millenia. Embracing and protecting more traditional or even indigenous land-management practices means we can apply techniques without major disruption or delay. 

My own personal interest however is exploring the role of technology tools and solutions in helping embrace these old/new approaches to producing our food in a sustainable, healthy and profitable way. 

Clearly there is a contradiction between returning to more traditional practices and technological innovation - sometimes not the most sustainable from environmental perspectives. 

Areas of agritech: 

- information services - soil, crop health analysis made possible through direct data capture 
- Automation and robotics - automate tasks or tools to complement existing processes
- Decision support tools - spotting trends in the data lanscape, helping us understand our actions and the effects they have on the system
