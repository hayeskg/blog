# APPROPRIATE TECH - STRIKING BALANCE BETWEEN INNOVATION AND DEGROWTH

As world leaders descend on the COP26 conference and plant-based canop√©s in Glasgow this month, our collective attention will rightly be focused on the climate crisis we are living in and how our elected leaders propose dealing with it. Mostly it's about priorities. The science is increasingly hard to ignore and voters are holding their governments to account. Governments, business and communities all have a role to play and there is an urgency to act like never before.
Most individuals are now aware of the stark correlation (and contradiction) between our high-growth economies and consumer behaviour and keeping our global emissions below a level to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C annualy. Some may argue this is still too high and others will certainly lobby to carry on with business as usual - but this arbitrary figure seems to have captured the collective imagination and formed a concensus, a common goal to aim for.

The big question for technologists is can we engineer a way of limiting global emissions? How responsible is innovation for driving carbon emissions in the first place? What is the role of engineers and entrepreneurs shaping new technologies in reigning in rampant emissions and decarbonising our economies? It's easy to wrap ourselves in the comfort of the technocratic view that we can engineer ourselves out of global crisis, but where does responsibility start for behaviour change? In this post I will look at examples of unsustainable models of growth and alternatives - moving at pace, with intention, towards impactful solutions to transform the very systems that we rely on so heavily, but simply can't sustain any longer.

## Colonising the universe or living in caves?

Neither, please. Part of human nature is a fundamental curiousity about the world around us. It is by fostering this urge to explore that we have been able to evolve, adapt and change course as individuals and as a species and build comfort, convenience, beauty and security into our lives and societies. This curiosity and increasingly sophisticated set of tools at our disposal will be used to push boundaries of our understanding of the universe. Can we really fault scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs for thinking big and wanting to explore space for further raw materials? To understand the origin of the universe? To better describe the non-linearity in our scientific understanding? On one level I can relate to the wonder and excitement that comes with dreaming, designing and building technology to solve problems previously thought unsolvable (regardless of the scale of impact).

What I am more concerned about is that we seem to focus all this attention on pushing a model that has already wreacked havoc to one planet. Part of good engineering is learning from mistakes - this is a difficult process - it hurts pride, professional ego, requires introspection and difficult truths. But only by taking a step back and evaluating exponential economic growth (thanks to industrial revolutions of the past 250 years) through the lens of new scientific understanding can we truly appreciate the full picture. Thanks to rigorous science we now have a superior understanding of the impact of economic growth on the health of our planet, ecosystems and society. The logical next step then is to change course, act and continue to evolve with this new information in hand.

## Degrowth - busting myths

Do we all need to go back to hunting and gathering our food, cooking by campfire and living in caves? Clearly not (although some people seem to think it makes for a fun holiday)! Building new economic systems that are not solely focused on short-term economic gain doesn't automatically mean poverty and suffering. We already have good examples of organisations rejecting the status quo and experimenting with new forms of corporate structures or financial systems. Innovation in this area however can only thrive if the systems around it are supportive. If a business that makes its fundamental mission to provide value in a community, a decent living for their employees, protect natural environments and return a fair and appropriate profit to its investors will suffer if the metrics it is evaluated on are solely focused on year on year growth and shareprice hike. Reshaping this short-termist thinking, reprioritising core values and measuring success in more holistic ways is arguably behind the term degrowth. Or as one contemporary degrowth thinker, Vincent Liegey would say - decolonising our growth imaginary. Isn't that a fitting contrast to space colonisation?

## Engineering circular systems

I am clearly no economists, so I will inevitably approach the question of economic transition from an engineer's perspective.

System change is a hefty subject that spans multiple disciplines. Economists and financiers are debating new structures and models for a more circular economy. Sociologists and policymakers are shaping new ideas on how society could function without the onus on growth. Architects, engineers and makers will design and build better tools, environments and processes with the latest scientific knowledge and historical evidence. This latter area is where I have the most input and motivation to exert change - in mindset first, then in action.

With the democratising force of the Internet, just like in many other profession, in engineering too there is a large shake-up of possibilities. Suddenly academic papers and reasearch can be accessed world wide. Online forums on all manner of niche subjects help people working on similar topics connect, share findings and approaches. This dynamic, inexpensive exchange of ideas, along with advances in computer science and electronics (making computer chips small and cheap - a growth paradox?) has given rise to a brand of open-source, diy, enthusiast engineer - solving problems in ingenious, creative ways. Traditional market forces make their innovations cost-effective, while a sense of ownership may drive incremental improvements. There's a motto amongst entrepreneurial developers and engineers - make something that solves a pain you have in life. Once you have solved it, look up and around and see who else has got a similar problem. This approach is truly innovative in more than just a few ways. The maker will use resources most readily available to them - open source software and hardware for prototyping (the mighty Raspberry Pi deserves a mention for building a huge community of computing enthusiasts). They will then have to find solutions without the noise of high costs, physical location or lack of guidance and often the results are brilliant, but more often they are terrible.

So why am I encouraging this seemingly futile approach to designing and building solutions? One reason is how we have come to frame failure in our growth-obsessed economies as something to be aware of. It's a money pit, a time warp, bad for business. This is true, if we look at short-term goals. However, not allowing ourselves to fail in turn increases pressure on having to succeed. Succeeding at all costs is risky, illogical and unsustainable. Yet we seem to still believe that great new innovations can happen without experimentation. And let's face it, experimentation is all about failure. We need to reframe failure as an opportunity to learn, to do it better next time, to explore alternatives. We need to adapt the systems around us that benefit from innovation to accept this also.

Embracing small, iterative, incremental improvements to a system allows it to evolve. It may mean that it is never deemed ready or complete, but it has an opportunity to react, adapt to and thrive amidst new, previously unforseen constraints.

Before the democratising force of the Internet, the engineering profession, much like many others relied heavily on the power and influence of big business. Research and development was expensive, so it was either public spending (through academic means or otherwise) or internal corporate projects that would drive new findings - often working hand in har

## Open sourcing appropriate technology

Open-source principles go back to the fundamental aims of academia - freedom of thought and exchange of knowledge. For centuries we have built a culture around science which relies on shared knowledge, exchange of ideas and constructive criticism. The scientific progress resulting from this 'melting pot of ideas' has benefitted society in countless ways. Understanding our bodies and biological processes means better, longer lives. New materials mean better buildings, infrastructure, objects. Climate research helps us understand the impact we have on our planet. In short, open-sourcing ideas is a driver for progress in society. When we talk about open-source technology in a modern engineering context, we often refer to software or code that has been published online to be used, modified and benefit from freely. It's like an encyclopedia, or rather a vast, distributed library of techniques and instructions to solve problems with computers.

The impact of open-source software is undeniable over the last couple of decades. As personal computing and home internet connections appeared in the 2000s, the world opened up to a global community of makers, tinkerers, problem solvers. With little more than a PC and bags of enthusiasm, anybody can build whatever they can dream up. You could learn web development to promote your business online. You could build a home automation server to control your lights through your phone. You could build an app that reminds you to put your laundry on or find public restrooms. Whatever your real-world problem, through translating it into code, chances are a solution can be built. Chances are it may already be built, in which case it can be co-opted, improved, built upon further.

From garage tinkerers the momentum has grown enough that the last decade has seen businesses recognise the value of open-source too. In a shift from protectionism, there's a valid alternative to patenting new research and hiding it from people who may want to copy it. Instead the value proposition is reversed and a user and developer community is actively encouraged to copy said piece of the puzzle. It allows a component to be the best it can be (supported by a peer network of contributors) and to fit into a patchwork system more effectively. It requires us to seek value, not in the puzzle piece, but in the final picture.

The coming years will see an expansion of open source ideas in other aspects of technology. People are sharing designs for gardening tools, plant-based materials, connected and distributed systems to solve real-world problems with the appropriate amount of complexity. The work becomes less about coming up with entirely new fundamental or base propositions and more about integrating a set up peer-reviewed, trusted and stable subsystems into a working, evolving, dynamic system. An active maintainer role is highlighted for the modern engineer. Through research and development libraries and resources are created, shared, identified and evaluated. Through the later stages of turning a design into reality and then supporting it throughout its lifecycle, additional roles emerge for the maker. Chances are that the learning is valuable to a wider community - other engineers, makers, tinkerers, designers or artists grappling with similar problems or building systems where the missing puzzle may be our little piece. Sharing this knowledge for the benefit of others through contribution and review makes for even stronger, trusted building blocks for futuer systems.

In the more physical disciplines of engineering, we are now seeing slow but steady embrace of open source principles. Electronics have become small, low-cost, readily available. With embedded software, enthusiasts and professionals alike can develop smart devices at negligable hardware cost and virtually free software. The investment is that of time and effort, which is absolutely worthwhile. Spending time fine-tuning the problem the proposed solution is fixing requires much more subject-matter knowledge and localised knowledge, so it makes sense to assign the core of the work there. Once the problem is correctly framed and the motivations for solving them decided, building a solution with open-source technologies (increasingly in the physical realm too) becomes less of a challenge.

# Why is open-source sustainable?

In this slight divergence from my starting point of growth-based economies and their fundamental conflict with living within our planetary means, let me try and bring the two together. I propose that through open-sourcing our technology needs and solutions we will only engineer what is needed instead of what we can create a market for. It's the pull vs push argument borrowed from lean manufacturing. Instead of pushing the next best digital marketing analysis tool onto an already saturated and ballooned market, we could wait for the needs of businesses and individuals to create the need for a solution. Once there is enough of a community, the makers and contributors will build it. If there is a genuine business need for it, finaincial backing becomes less of an issue too. If we can let go of our need to patent and lock away our innovations and let others benefit from them, we will get better feedback on what we are building is valuable or not.

So as we all watch the next climate tech solutions being presented at COP26, let's ask ourselves the question - is this solving a problem that needs solving? Is the proposal using more resources to develop said technology than it's ultimate impact will be? Could we be looking at solutions that are already out there? Appropriate tech solutions will drive the reduction in our consumption, energy use and emissions.
