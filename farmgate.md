# From lab to field 2 - building Dug

This time last year I wrote a [blog](https://medium.com/me/stats/post/e1f37218fb0e) about the robotics development lifecycle and how with [E-Nano](https://www.e-nano.io/) we had started to move into the field for testing and reliability improvements.

When [listt.io](http://listt.io/) started later that year, it was with the intention of exploring the potential for autonomous ground truth solutions in agriculture. My professional experince in control systems, infrastructure, industrial automation, software development and prototyping was now guided by a desire to build impactful technology. Success will be measured in terms of the areas we can nudge towards practices that improve biodiversity - below and above ground - while staying productive of course.

The technical scope of the challenge was clear. We needed to continue showcasing robotics technology available to us an to start the iterative cycles that will later become farmer-led features. For this a portable, practical and engaging prototype had to be created. For speed and lowering complexity-based risk, an integration approach was taken. Existing sub-modules were combined into the listt.io design and interfaces defined - shaping what I would call an **appropriate robotics solution**.

The electric scout base was supplied by [Autodiscovery](https://autodiscovery.co.uk/), with a miniature penetrometer by E-Nano. We prioritised graphics power for computing, anticipating future features to revolve around machine vision. A mix of open-source electronics components and standard IT equipment meant our ultimate hardware bill remained appropriate too.

Reaching a maturity where we can consistently head out to agricultural land and conduct meaningful work - both in defining our commercial and practical value proposition, while refining the user experience. These insights will allow us to better understand our target user, map their needs and propose solutions. When our technology development is guided by real world farmer needs, we have confidence we will be delivering the solutions that are truly required.

After our first few outings with the robot, people started asking about a name. It never really felt like a particularly pressing priority, but I guess clever people say you must listen to your users first and foremost. So after much deliberation - over refreshments - our `robot` was named Dug. It's not the perfect name, but seems to be sticking - a little like our project?

# Grazing and grasslands monitoring

This hypothesis has been confirmed with our latest project looking at grazing patterns, soil organic content and grassland biodiversity.

# Scaling

When grant funding was identified and secured, the resources could be allocated to start hardware development and integration work. In parallel, making initial connections with the wider farming and agriculture sector and applying for further business support opportunities were happening.

What happens next is a more challenging aspect of the work - at least for most engineers. We need to continue to get out of our
