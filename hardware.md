# Hardware is hard - the ag robotics adoption curve

In this blog post I want to reflect on the world of imapct startups building **hardware** - through my lens as a part-time founder, part-time employee, the challenges, the opportunities, the tears and the smiles.

All early businesses must get to grips with a certain risk profile. There's an understanding that upfront effort will not yield immediate results. In the majority of cases even with hard work, dedication, investments and revenue, startups never make it to true, long-term profitability. Introduce the complexities and overheads of hardware developement and the odds are even slimmer. Yet there are an increasing number of startups who despite the odds, want to be working on **real(world)** problems. There's only so many software solutions our overleveraged economies can take - sold to us as quick, cheap fixes for our rapidly accelerating global crises. Gut feel tells us that if we want to dig deeper and get to the root of issues, we might actually need to pick up a spade.

## A journey into hardware

The farming terminology is no accident. I have personal experience of 'more than bargained for' summer work experiences on my father's organic vegetable farm. The work was character building - a polite way of saying tough. Yet I strongly believe that a work ethic developed close to the living world helped me understand that solutions have 2 layers - intellectual and execution. One without the other won't yield the desired effects.

I was always fascinated by the mixing of these two skills which further developed during my studies of electronics. I loved learning about how computers we all use for abstract intellectual activities are actually electrons racing around thousands of switches making up circuits. Ah, the satisfying convergence of the two solution layers - I was hooked.

In my subsequent career I have always sought working on electronic systems that **touch** the real world - ideally to make it a better place. When my corporate work started turning too abstract and commercial, I had to re-align my priorities. I felt startup could offer me the freedom to put theory into practice and start building, experimenting in the real world.

I am privileged to have worked in a number of hardware businesses where I've been building increasingly complex systems to automate and connect and measure using physical machines. At The Tyre Collective, I joined a dedicated team working on collecting tyre wear at source, a major source of global microplastics pollution. We use electrostatics to **hoover** up particulates - improving air and water quality. At listt.io, my own fledgling venture, I develop robotic solutions for nature friendly farming applications. Both give me a sense of purpose, but it's not all clear sailing...

## Funding hardware startups

Apologies for stating the obvious economics here, but hardware costs money. You can simulate it to a certain extent, but eventually you need to build a prototype to test. Components won't show up, it won't work as expected, it will **BREAK**. You will need somewhere to tinker, then you will need transport to get the thing to where you want to test it. You will need to hire people who have skills beyond keyboard bashing.

Traditional businesses will have an R&D department which understands these economic realities, and ideally the opportunities too - they can internalise these costs into their wider operational costs. For startups whose existence depends on experimenting, these costs far outweight all others on a balance sheet. At a glance then they're not businesses at all, they are endless money pits. Black holes of investment with returns materialising in some galaxy far far away.

The _startup industry_ is intimately linked to the _venture capital_ world. I'm no financial analyst, but since my time working in startups, I hear of investors expecting quick, safe returns. Nothing wrong with that, but the risk profile will only align with certain activities - software based sales lead generation tools and the likes - i.e. very far from the type of impactful, hardware-dependend, slow-building ventures I write about above.

Hardware startups need a different class of investor - one who can see the long-term, bigger picture and isn't scared of the long and rocky load leading to it. That sounds great on the surface, but if we think of our own savings - why would anyone choose a less favourable financial return over the relatively safe bet of the next SaaS fintech startup? Yet they do exist, farmers and landowners often have to take a long view - planting trees is very often a 10-20 year return. Building major infrastructure takes decades. Both lead to benefits beyond individual returns. Could hardware startups tap into these networks, blending the benefits of classic technology startups, coupled with more long-term, values-based, perhaps even philantropic funding perspective. The phrase, be the change you wish to see in the world springs to mind.

## Hardware startups need sales leadership

Personally less experienced on the sales and revenue generation side of startups, I do recognise it is an essential part of success - arguably even more than the technology **employed** to solve a problem. A true business opportunity identifies a target customer or user group and offers ways to make their lives easier - ideally having a positive impact in the process.

Here it's important to exercise a healthy dose of self-criticism as engineers and technologists. We collectively suffer (generalising here) from a superficial approach to user research. We delve into technical details too soon, before the problem statement is properly researched and formulated. This, coupled with the increased overheads mentioned above make for a particularly unattractive risk profile. What can be done to remedy this?

Again, I'm primarily referencing my own limited experience here, but I feel that success must come from a team of people with complementary skills. On the one hand technical leadership is required. Who else is going to find an effective way through hardware product development from uber-fragile prototypes held together by sticky tape and intense concentration to slick, robust, appropriate machines. On the other hand this along is not enough. Celebrating skill for it's own sake only has limite virtue - like awaring a gold medal for the fastest athlete around the track at the Olympics. Building a business over decades requires stamina and support, which comes from a team.

Having benefitted from some business coaching recently, I have a new found respect for the process and positivity required for business development and sales. Hardware startups require exceptionally skilled, motivated and patient sales teams. The skill is in balancing communication channels, internally with the R&D function and externally to a constantly evolving user and customer base. The motivation is needed to go out and have abstract conversations with a community who are probably somewhat sceptictical of adoption even before the economic realities are revealed. Finally patience, for the longer timeframes and _engineer-coaxing_ inherent to hardware.

## Learning to celebrate small wins and failures

In the face of all these challenges some founders still choose to work on hardware-based solutions to wicked, complex, global issues. There must be some virtue there, but careful approach to planning, risk management and execution is needed. The key relationships that are emphasised in all startups - team, customers, advisors, investors take on additional meaning when considering hardware.

As I write this, I grapple with the financial future of listt.io beyond our intial grant-funded 2 years. Not quite reaching commercial revenue and not quite ready for classic venture capital investment, we are facing what is often characterised as **the valley of death** where available resources have been exhausted and the customer value proposition not quite defined yet. That said a **LOT** has happened in the past 2 years which gives me reasons to celebrate - real machines taking shape, many conversations with farmers and preparing for our fist robotic farming trial.

Even if we go under in the current setup, new successes will emerge from the embers so we can continue to innovate and move towards providing solving those truly complex problems we all care about!
