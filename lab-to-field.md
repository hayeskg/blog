# Lab to field - a journey in robotics

## Build up

In 2020, when the word _pandemic_ was still confined to thriller movie plots instead of 24 hour news cycles, I was thinking hard about the next move in my work. I'd left my graduate role with a large corporate (Bosch) a few years prior along with it's stable, sensible approach to professional development. I was impatient, ready to meet people, go and see engineering in action and learn about the business of automating processes. The team at Beijer, a scandinavian automation provider gave me the opportunity to develop an emerging, ambitious market around industrial IoT. I joined the UK team who gave me freedom, trust, support and lots of opportunities to learn and grow. By early 2020 I'd figured out business development, but was getting less hands on with engineering solutions. It was too soon to give up on this part of my development, I knew I had to keep my technical skills sharp.

I joined a software development programme just as the world descended into lockdowns and immersed myself in learning about open-source software development, remote teams, early startups and personal projects. Taking on a new type of risk and accepting uncertainty in my work felt less alien when the world outside was going through such novel and unprecedented turmoil. I knew I was on the right track in looking to join a startup and see a project grow.

As well as the relative challenges of lockdown (bear a thought for those key workers putting a real shift in during these times), it was a time for introspection. After years of travelling every week, I suddenly had time to stop, reflect and pivot towards something that would keep me motivated and occupied for the next period. In the language of tired business speak, it was time to define my mission statement. A naive, inaccurate attempt at best, it went something like this:

---

_I want to use my engineering-problem-solving mindset to tackle meaningful, impactful, urgent problems around food, climate and our environment._

---

With these ideas in my notepads and travel restrictions easing, it was time to take a train journey to Europe to see family and figure out my next move.

## Remote start

I met the E-Nano founders during the summer of 2020, remotely. We had good talks and I joined a team with a product manager and developer. We started building a cloud-based robotics platform with relevant UI and infrastructure. Productivity was high, people were getting ready for a winter of isolation. There was a certain 'well, this is a new format' smell in the air. Despite the distance in timezones and geographies, our work started to take shape, but so was the end of our runway. During that time there was real focus on building the future of the company with many personal risks taken. It paid off and further funding allowed us to plan the next year in London. By early 2021 I'd started to get familiar with the robotics architecture of the project. It was time to get into the lab and start building physical interfaces - robotics APIs - between our platform and 3rd party hardware. Benchtop proof of concepts were scaled to prototypes capable of automating essential human tasks.

## Into the lab

In the lab we started integrating 3rd party sensors with our robotics operating system. This meant standardising on an edge architecture in terms of electronics modules, embedded code and interfaces. Mechanical integrations were a constant feature of our calendar and so was the noisey metalwork echoing around the bowels of Somerset House. Our systems started to move, we developed controls and interfaces. Field visits to our turf research partner in Yorkshire meant real-world testing with added environmental challenges. It was good quality, dynamic, hands on engineering. Late in 2021 we had a number of early demos with our first prototype, Sprout. This proved invaluable in terms of learning reliability lessons. After a re-design, the winter was spent on the design, sourcing and building of our second, refined system. Many of the critical and more practical parts of the solution were overhauled. For our fast approaching field trial, we would be entering with a much stronger, resilient system.

## Fresh air

Our robot was working in lab conditions, the flow of information from sensors to our data our platform was proven - it was time to see if we could get some early feedback on our solution from real-world users. A Premier League football club was willing to provide an area at their training facility and we collected data from pitches every other day for 3 weeks. The feedback pushed us forward in terms of developing our reporting UI, core robotics funcionality (sample resolution, grid layouts) but most importantly, it allowed for a window into the world of elite grounds management. This type of learning is impossible to simulate in an academic or even commercial research environment - developing these relationships drive the refinement of our technical and commercial value propositions. With this learning and continuously improving our robot, we are building confidence in the products services we can offer early partners.

## Where next?

I am proud and happy for all the people I've worked with for getting the project this far, it's no mean feat - developing hardware-based robotics solutions is complex, risky and costly. Software startups come and go, but to build something that moves around and delivers value in the real world is a different story. The first step of this journey - building a prototype, testing it the lab, refining it, then seeing it take on real environments is a great achievement, but the work doesn't stop here.

For E-Nano, the immediate focus is to convert early clients in the sports industry, continuing the product development iterations and start generating revenue. I'm positive about their success, a hard-working, committed and technical team who are pragmatic problem-solvers who've learnt about a market quickly. The type of engineering problems that will be solved next are related to scaling up - building, deploying and supporting multiple units with early clients. It continues to be a fantastic opportunity to keep learning and growing.

We are starting to build our network externally - with the market, sure - but also with academic institutions and other startups. We are interested in where robotics are heading, we want to understand the technology startup landscape in the UK, we want to engage the next generation of engineers to helps us solve meaningful problems.

This final point is the most personal. Elite sports is the perfect training environemnts for developing robotics - good infrastructure, helpful teams, perfect surfaces. There are many efficiencies and quality improvements autonomous data collection tools can deliver. In parallel to this, I can feel momentum building behind ideas to build impactful, scalable solutions to some of our most burning issues - climate, food, environment. These intersect in agriculture, something I've been learning about more recently.

In order to bring robust, reliable, worthwhile robotics into agricultural environments, a few things must happen. Perhaps least worrying for an engineer is ruggedising their solution - better suspension, navigation, homing. What's more critical (and tricky to achieve) is getting feedback from the end-users, the clients, in this case the farmers. It's clear that no farmers can justify funding robotics R&D that may or may not provide direct benefit to his operations in the not too distant future. We need to simplify our value proposition to a point where a very simple solution start to deliver a very small value. Once this feedback loop is implemented, iterations can start and scaling can happen.

The task I see taking shape ahead for myself is to work with my network to propose a series of experiments. I'd like to put appropriate technology solutions to use on farms, solving real, meaningful problems, monitoring and acting on valuable processes. To push this forward I am starting more conversations with farmers, entrepreneurs and makers who also align in their mission of pushing for more ecologically sound practices in agriculture. I plan to travel to farms and conferences - to build up a database of problems that need solving - then start to shape prototypes and projects on the ground.
