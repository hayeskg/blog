# listt.io - appropriate technology solutions for regeneration

Listt.io recently became a company and I wanted share a bit of an inception story with early followers and supporters.

Listt.io as it stands today is the coming together of varied interests over the last few years. Work in engineering and technology startups and an increasing appetite for knowledge on all things climate, nature and food led me to focus on making better soil health data a priority - in my own life as well as others'.

The vision is to boost biodiversity of natural environments supported by appropariate technology solutions. My joint interest in measuring soil health and building appropriate technology solutions converge in the exploration of solutions for regenerative agriculture. Exciting opportunities emerge when exploring new models for prioritising soil, climate and planetary biodiversity in all areas of our lives. I'm convinced that technical solutions can contribute to accelerating the transition towards new agricultural systems - done in a way that benefits plants, people and planet.

A brand of solutions focused frugal, modelst systems with intelligence is building. Finding new components, connecting them in small systems, automating them and making them connect in networks. With open source software, low-cost electronics, rapid prototyping tools and lots of encouragement, anyone can build systems that will solve meaninful problems on farms. This includes those who are working hard growing our food, safeguarding our landscapes and building rural communities - farmers and growers, stewards of the land.

The listt.io mission is to bring the potential of appropriate technology solutions outdoors and into nature. Working with farmers and experts who are firmly rooted in their beliefs that we can work in partnership with nature, instead of pushing our ecosystems past equilibrium. The role of the on-farm CTO is emerging - leaving cosy labs for muddy fields, we are practical problem solvers ready to shape appropriate technology for regeneration.

Listt.io is just getting started - there's a lot of hard work, experimentation, learning and iteration ahead. If you're interested in collaborating on projects, finding out more about our autonomous soil health platform or would like a simple chat, do get in touch at kristof@listt.io.

Much of my day to day is spent defining problems and shaping solutions to them using low-footprint technologies. There is a beauty in cutting through complexity with simple, lightweight solutions that are open, configurable and yes, sometimes imperfect. This final point is an imporant one, if there are many benefits there must be a trade-off, it's imporant to recognise and accept this. But there are ways to mitigate risks from imperfection. Iteration - when right, with the user in a real environment, delivering value - even if that value is marginal at first, is necessary. Successful solutions involve the user, tests happen in meaninful environments, communication is distributed and effective, teams agile and approachable.

The potenetial that better data along a process can bring is undeniable. This is of course true of existing industiral processes and previously data scarce areas. Whether consicously or not we've all been subjected to the rise of digitisation for better or for worse. My view is that technology needs to be accessible in order for the value to benefit those using the technology, not

listt.io was founded to explore **appropriate technology solutions** to regenerate natural systems and processes.

It channels years of developing skills and networks across _engineering_, _technology_ and _startups_ with a **vision** to collaborate with people working tirelessly on regenerating to their immediate surroundings.

Change happens when **communities** form around a desire to **act**. _Experiments_ lead to _validation_ of ideas, enabling _impact_ to be made.

The **mission** is to co-create appropriate technology solutions to **regenerate natural systems**.
