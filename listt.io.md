# listt.io - appropriate technology solutions for regeneration

Listt.io recently became a company and I wanted to take the opportunity share a bit of backstory with early followers and supporters.

Listt.io as it stands currently is a the result of years' worth of conversations, professional pivots, research, prototypes and learning.

My vision is to enable and accelerate the health of our natural environments with appropariate technology solutions. The foundation is my professional background as an engineer, tech enthusiast (with caveats!) and general problem solver. The other half is my desire to spend my time working on problems that matter to me, my community and my environment. These two halves converge in the exploration of regenerative agriculture - a huge and exciting area where new models for prioritising our soil, climate, food, health, biodiversity are emerging. I'm convinced that technical solutions are needed to solve some of the challenges around transitioning towards these new agricultural systems - I am also convinced that this should be done in a way that benefits plants, people and planet not only large corporate structures.

Much of my day to day is spent defining problems and shaping solutions to them using low-footprint technologies. There is a beauty in cutting through complexity with simple, lightweight solutions that are open, configurable and yes, sometimes imperfect. This final point is an imporant one, if there are many benefits there must be a trade-off, it's imporant to recognise and accept this. But there are ways to mitigate risks from imperfection. Iteration - when right, with the user in a real environment, delivering value - even if that value is marginal at first, is necessary. Successful solutions involve the user, tests happen in meaninful environments, communication is distributed and effective, teams agile and approachable.

My brand of solutions focuses on electronics and software systems. I find new sensors, connect them in small circuits, control them with some code, connect them to computers on local or remote networks. With the advent of open source software, low-cost electronics, rapid prototyping tools and some encouragement, anyone can build systems that will solve meaninful problems. This includes those who are working hard growing our food, safeguarding our landscapes, building rural communities - farmers and growers.

The listt.io vision is to bring the potential of appropriate technology solutions onto farms. I want to work with farmers who are firmly rooted in their beliefs that we can work in partnership with nature, embrace it's full potential and complexity and still produce healthy, nutritious food instead of pushing our ecosystmes past equilibrium. I want to develop relationships where we learn together - about ecosystem health, how to best act on the data collected, experiment with new economic models that benefit the many on the ground instead of a select few. I see the role of the on-farm CTO emerging - a practical problem solver with a sensitivity to core values of a farming operation who can provide support, insight and advice on how to best make use of appropriate technologies.

Listt.io is just getting started - there's a lot of hard work, experimentation, learning and pivoting ahead,. The destination is not crystal clear, but there's a strong true North compass on deck and the journey offers adventures and fulfilment along the way.

The potenetial that better data along a process can bring is undeniable. This is of course true of existing industiral processes and previously data scarce areas. Whether consicously or not we've all been subjected to the rise of digitisation for better or for worse. My view is that technology needs to be accessible in order for the value to benefit those using the technology, not

Being a viable business may be some way off, but the

listt.io was founded to explore **appropriate technology solutions** to regenerate natural systems and processes.

It channels years of developing skills and networks across _engineering_, _technology_ and _startups_ with a **vision** to collaborate with people working tirelessly on regenerating to their immediate surroundings.

Change happens when **communities** form around a desire to **act**. _Experiments_ lead to _validation_ of ideas, enabling _impact_ to be made.

The **mission** is to co-create appropriate technology solutions to **regenerate natural systems**.
