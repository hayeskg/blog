# listt.io - appropriate technology solutions for regeneration

[Listt.io](https://listt.io/) recently became a company and I wanted share some of the background story with early followers and supporters.

As it stands today, listt.io is the coming together of interests that have been maturing over the last few years. Work in _engineering and technology_ startups and an increasing appetite for learning about all things _climate, nature and agriculture_ has led me to focus my work on improving access to better soil health data.

The guiding **_vision_** is to boost soil biodiversity and that of natural environments supported with the help of appropariate technology solutions. My joint interests of learning how to measure _soil health_ and building _appropriate technology solutions_ converge in the exploration of solutions for **regenerative agriculture**. Exciting opportunities are emerging for people wanting to farm closer to nature, regenerate landscapes or build responsible businesses. I'm convinced that technical solutions can contribute to accelerating the transition towards agricultural systems that work for **_plants, people and planet_**.

A brand of lightweight, flexible systems with intelligence is emerging in agtech. Integrating the latest _sensor_ technologies, interfacing them to small, _automated_ systems, connecting them in _networks_, digging into _data_ - this is what listt.io wants to enable. With open source software, low-cost electronics, rapid prototyping tools and a bit of encouragement, **farming businesses can start to build their own systems** to solve everyday needs.

The listt.io **mission** is to bring the potential of appropriate technology solutions onto farms and into fields. We want to work with people who produce food, build soil and care for landscapes in _partnership with nature_, instead of pushing these ecosystems past equilibrium. In a supporting role, that of the _on-farm CTO_ is emerging - experienced engineers leaving cosy labs for muddy fields, ready to shape **appropriate technology for regeneration**.

Listt.io is just getting started - there's a lot of hard work, experimentation, learning and iteration ahead, so we need all the support and encouragement we can get.

If you're interested in collaborating on projects, finding out more about our autonomous soil health platform or would just like a brief chat, do get in touch at kristof@listt.io.
