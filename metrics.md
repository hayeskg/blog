As I reflect on a successful 2022, I find myself preoccupied with natural resources - their origin, their utility and their impact. Let me expand.

During the last year I started to develop my ideas around appropriate technology solutions for agriculture. It coincided with a reshuffling of my professional roles and a continued anxiety to start building something of my own which will have a positive impact on the world around me. The impact I want to have is ultimately a more liveable planet for all. The most practical and accessible solutions in my eyes are found in how we manage our natural resources. Instead of extracting them to prop up our balance sheets for yet another season, we must start to properly account for their use and think about their finite (or in some case infinite) nature.

Agriculture is the practice of managing landscapes while producing food to sustain human life on Earth. We've successfully built systems that allow a small number of people to work in the rural economy to produce the quantity of calories required - well, mostly. It is becoming evident, however, that these systems are utterly unsustainable - they rely on extracting natural resources without replenishing them. This has lead to degraded soils around the world - a huge worry, both in terms of global warming and having enough to eat.

Returning to practices which have evolved organically from natural processes in farming allows us to work in harmony with nature, replenishing essential resources instead of eeking out yet another fragile harvest. Focusing on building soil while producing food - embracing and promoting complex biodiversity below the surface of our Earth - is broadly called regenerative agriculture. The ecological case for transitioning to such systems at scale is compelling - but what of economics?

Being an idealist, it's difficult to get dragged down to the reality of figures. However, there is no successful model for regeneration without a compelling business case (as dry as that sounds). What feels necessary, is to redefine the value that is created in such a business and properly account for it. If a farmer is producing x % less in a crop but with y % less inputs, that may still be a viable business. If, in addition, there is additional value created - better soil resilience, more biodiversity, more nutrients - surely that's a more successful business. Should such a business not be compensated for this? If a market is unable to recognise this value is it the farming system that needs fixing or the market metrics against which it's measured? I'm increasingly convinced that it is indeed the latter.

As I gear up for a busy 2023 developing appropariate technology solutions to support growers, farmers and land workers in their tireless work to safeguard and regenerate natural reasources, I anticipate a new economics to follow suit. Trust I'm not alone!
