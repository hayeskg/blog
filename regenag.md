# A brief look at regenerative agriculture

## Why agriculture, why change and why now?

Those who've had the opportunity to be bored by my ideas over the last year or so may have picked up on my (re)newed interest in agriculture and farming. This may be a suprise for my more engineering and technology oriented friends, but for others it begs the question - why hasn't it come sooner? For context, I have family links to a fab little organic farm in Hungary, a place I was able to visit more regularly over the last year. You can check them out online or in person if you fancy a day trip out from Budapest - https://en.zsambokibiokert.hu/. Along with changes in my professional life and the global pandemic framing everything in a new light, a clear focus is taking shape in my work - investigating the role technology can play in how we produce our food and manage our land in a fair and sustainable way.

When societies hunkered down around the world in early 2020, we truly came to appreciate the scale and complexity of our distributed food supply chains. So many of us city dwellers take it for granted that we can turn up at a supermarket and have a vast range of fresh (and not so fresh) produce to choose from at incredibly low prices, all year round. When disruptions to these long supply chains started to ripple, our deep-rooted instincts manifested themselves in slightly dystopian (and somewhat comic) stock-piling of tinned foods, loo roll and other basics.

Lockdowns forced us to slow down and **think** about the absurdity of some of our habits. Food being such a fundamental part of our life - providing nutrition, enjoyment, health and entertainment, people rightly questioned the sustainability and quality of the produce they were consuming. I see it as a silver lining that a more conscious consumer has emerged on the other side of a challenging 18 months, one who is willing to pay a premium for seasonal, local and ultimately more sustainable produce. It's worth mentioning here that I experienced the above and am subsequently writing this from a priviliged standpoint. I urge everyone to think about the challenges around access to good quality, locally produced, affordable food for all in their communities and how this could change where it needs to.

As an engineer thinking in terms of systems, I am inevitably drawn to _how_ we make an impact at scale. In particular, I'm drawn towards applying new models in agriculture - the commercial use of land to procude good quality, healthy food for us all. I like that with relatively small shifts in mindsets across consumers, growers and everyone inbetween, the potential for impact is huge - simply due to scale. In this post I will briefly share my understanding of what it means to farm land in a way that builds soil instead of depleting it, boosting biodiversity and encouraging healthy, natural ecosystems to thrive while delivering better yields for growers and great produce for all. The potential for these techniques to be framed as climate solutions is incredibly exciting too, again when considering global scale. The tools and frameworks that will contribute to their adoption lend themselves to open, cummunity-led technologies, where the role of engineers and makers can start to be (re)defined as collaborators and partners.

## Farming as usual

Farming has allowed people to settle into more permanent lifestyles and form communities around favourable, fertile landscapes. Tending to land is as much a fundamental part of our society, as food is a part of our lives. Human innovation provided better tools and techniques to encourage ever more abundant and varied harvests season after season. Just like many other aspects of modern life, agriculture too was changed by a series of industrial revolutions throughout relatively recent history.

Thanks to the progress of science and engineerin, farmers were able to influence their natural surroundings to a greater extend, in order to produce goods that were increasingly being sold to more distant, distributed markets. The Dust Bowl in the Great Plains of North America in the 1930s is a culturally relevant illustration from less than 100 years ago. Due to historical and economic factors, farmers were converting native grassland into farmland through at an astonishing rate. Deep plowing meant the soil structure was weakened, fields were left bare during winters, natural water regulation was disrupted. The resulting wind erosion and droughts caused the displacement of millions of people and inspired cultural figures at the time like John Steinbeck and Woody Guthrie to comment on the human side of this tragedy. We now know that this would have caused an immense release of soil carbon into the atmosphere, something we've only been concerned with more recently in the context of climate change.

Unfortunately, industrial agriculture has carried on in a similar vein every since. Farmers are competing on complex, global markets. They are being forced into unfair positions of choosing between short-term gain (for survival) versus a long-term view of less intensive production that would allow soils to regenerate and build fertility over time. They must make the economics work and compete with nature instead of embracing their role as guardians of the land for future generations to come. They are offered heavy, mechanised tools and chemical inputs to eek out increasingly slim margins from their assets - soil. In a race for profits, we risk a race to the bottom in terms of food and environmental standards.

These issues are starting to be recognised at policy level. Erosion of fertile topsoil is a global issue recognised by the UN, who's FAO agency believe we only have 60 harvests left if we continue along the current path...

## What is regenerative agriculture?

So is it all doom and gloom? Well, not necessarily.

Our planet has tools at its disposal that are not revolutionary at all, in fact, they've been around way before humans cultivated land. Natural ecosystems have an amazing ability to regenerate and regain balance, often doing this faster **without** human intervention than with it. The benefits are becoming increasingly clear when evaluating them through the modern scientific lens of measurement and analysis and ideas like rewilding becoming household names.

Agriculture is a little different. If we let nature completely take over, we could never harvest enough to feed our populations. We must find ways to work in collaboration with our natural environments instead of against them and harness the power of the 'factory default' regenerative processes. And if we wish to grow crops, it has to start with soil.

In short, regenerative agriculture is all about building up soils instead of depleting them. Healthy soils are full of life and biodiversity, sometimes even more so below the surface than above. When soils are living and healthy they are teeming with acitivity - insect and bacterial life depend on a tight networks of mychorrizal fungi and plant roots. These roots are the infrastructure to transport and manage the flow of water and nutrients for plants to grow above ground and roots to push down further into the soil. Organic matter is created through chemical processes, helping crops grow when planted with all the infrastructure already in place - nutrition rich, moisture regulated soils with structure. Such soils are abundant and resilient to disease and erosion from water or wind and help crops grow fast and strong. They also lock away atmospheric gases such as carbon in significant quantities.

This last point is an incredibly powerful attribute. Sure, on an individual plant basis the amount of carbon stored is miniscule. But if we scale our thinking across agricultural land across the globe the impact can be staggering. What's even more dizzying is the speed at which this regeneration and subsequent acceleration of the carbon cycle can happen. All that is needed is for farmers and growers to be incentivised and motivated enough to start transitioning towards more ecologically-rooted farming practices.

Introducing crop rotations allow soils to rebalance nutrients over a cycle of seasons. Planting cover crops in winter provides the ground with a protective layer against diseases. Using crimpers to manage weed growth and seed drills for planting, soil root systems aren't disturbed and are allowed to expand further over seasons - further speeding up the carbon drawdown cycle. With livestock, natural fertilizers can be applied directly onto pasture land through intensive or mob grazing. The result is more fertile ground with more resilient, bountiful yields. New, diverse crops mean that farms can start to explore new revenue streams and be more financially resilient across seasons.

## Policy and markets recognising the benefits

Modern commercial farming is a precarious business. There are risks to balance, margins to manage and bills to pay. Expecting individual farmers to take on even more risk and make the transition into the unknown based on an inner calling or sense of duty is naive and unfair. Policy must pave the way in enabling a transition by providing and regulating new ways farming businesses are incentivised. As recognition grows around the need for more resilience in our food systems, more biodiversity in our natural environments and viable climate solutions, the role of farmers can evolve from purely food procuders to land managers and ecological service providers.

Policymakers worldwide are shaping their future farming visions in line with this - it's encouraging but a timely execution is also needed and for engaged citizens to hold their governments to account.

- DEFRA in the UK is shifting its farming subsidies towards Environmental Land Management Scheme (ELMS) which would see farmers getting public support for ecological and biodiversity services provided instead of being paid by acreage (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/farmers-invited-to-take-first-step-towards-greener-future)
- The European Commissions is moving away from it's Common Agricultural Policy towards the European Green Deal - prioritysing _farm to fork_ and biodiversity schemes (https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/farming/organic-farming/organic-action-plan_en)
- The US and Australia all have vibrant regenerative agriculture movements gathering pace.

Capital markets are also taking note. The dual benefits of ecological services provided and economic returns from new revenue streams is an attractive long-term investment opportunity. In emerging carbon markets, credits will be traded between net emitters and accredited 'storers'. Allowing agricultural businesses to enter these markets as value creators will see them play an entirely new role in the circular economy.

## New tools and frameworks to help the transition

This is where I propose engineers, technology providers and data professionals have an ideal opportunity to start getting involved. Although on the surface some of the regenerative agriculture practices require a 'step back' approach, letting natural processes do their thing, there are certain areas where the best tools available can and should be deployed. The approach will have to be collaborative. Engineers and farmers will need to work closely to truly understand the opportunities and limitations that technologies can offer.

Perhaps the biggest such area is **measurement**. Rigurous scientific process doesn't have to be abandoned just because we embrace natural solutions. In fact, accurate, meaningful data to understand our hugely complex ecosystems may help us work even closer with it. This is where **sensor technologies** around soil nutrients, structure and organic carbon are hugely important - benchmarking the _current_ vs the _improved_. Measuring progress is essential - for farmers, investors and public agencies to accurately make strategic decisions. How can we sell soil carbon credits without accurately verifying it has been stored? Similarly with crop health, understanding the plant processes during its lifecycle allows agronomists and growers to react in real-time to changing environments - fine-tuning processes and ultimately reducing the use of _blunt tools_.

Bringing the latest **IoT** (internet of things) technologies into the fields means more granular, precise data that supports everyday decisions for growers as well as providing the basis of further analytics over. Low cost, open source **edge computing** is becoming cheaper and more accessible, meaning the barriers of entry are being lowered rapidly. Deploying sensors in fields sounds low-tech, but it brings with it a unique set of challenges around connectivity, power and reliability.

**Automation** and **robotics** is another relevant area. There are global shortages of manual labour adding to the stresses on the agricultural sector. On the one hand automating existing tasks is important, but autonomous robots that can collaborate and offer a range of tooling can change the way a farm operates. It's important to stress here, that the aim is not to displace further workers, but to attract a wider group of people towards agriculture by providing meaningful, innovative solutions to real problems.

Once a farm has started on its digital transformation journey, the possibilities multiply exponentially. Deploying **machine learning** models can be used to find correlations between seemingly disconnected data sets. Inefficiencies around processes can be ironed out. More profitable products and services can be created. Testing and validating new ideas becomes less risky.

It's our role as engineers and technologists to demystify and make accessible these solutions for an entirely new user group - the grower, farm or land manager. We must build trust by building small technology experiements that improve incrementally, demonstrating value to all parties in the process. There's a unique opportunity to connect stakeholders from varies background - with different skills, views and values.

After some years of focusing on engineering, software and technology, I am excited and relieved to have found an area where I can channel my professional energy. I am confident that regenerative agriculture is here to stay and can provide value to our planet and communities. Applying my technical skills in this direction gives me purpose and motivation.

I wanted too give my friends, peers and contacts a bit of a view into my thinking on this matter, if nothing else to spark discussion. Exchanging ideas, influencing each others' viewpoints, debating is all a healthy part of innovating. I want engineers to talk to farmer and listen to their pain points. I want farmers to listen to engineers and understand the limitations and opportunities and ways of working. I would like to reach and connect with people who are passionate about building a more sustainable, resilient and diverse agriculture sector, one that embraces new tools. One that values people, plants and the planet.

healthy soils -> healthy plant -> healthy food -> healthy people -> healthy communities -> healthy societies -> healthy environments -> healthy planet

And so the circularity continues...♼

s a new vision for resiliant food systems emerge in policy they will make their way into practice over the coming decades. Regulators, growers, financiers and other stakeholders will need to start measuring progress - once the right metrics for progress have been established.

This is where I see the opportunity for technology to play a new and significant role in this new landscape. If subsidies are linked to soil and crop health, evidence is needed to support payments. In an increasingly digitalised economy, the currency is relevant, granular data across new frameworks that are emerging.

Soil health and condition monitoring is a good place to start. By developing automated and autonomous systems which can provide accurate and up to date data on how soils health is improving will provide farmers with the hard evidence of their efforts and give confidence to backers - governmental or free market - about the impact.

Measuring soils nutrients, microorganisms, the carbon sequestered are all interesting metrics and there is an opportunity to start applying technologies that have transformed other parts of our economy to our fields. Web technologies, IoT connectivity, robotics and data analysis are all important areas that are being adapted support agricultural markets.

Developing these technologies requires strong and focused financial and innovation frameworks, to mitigate risks and make the long-term investment in terms of time, effort and resources.

It's possible to view ecological practices in agriculture as something only relating to agriculture. The benefits are clear in that more narrow context. I am intrigued however to see the transition towards regenartive agriculture as a climate solution that can scale globally with a low barrier of entry. Shifting from farming methods that contribute to the emission of greenhouse gases to ones which can reduce the amount of atmospheric carbon and reduce the heating of our planet seems like a neat idea.

The strange thing is that there is nothing revolutionary about these principles. Natural ecosystems have worked in balance for houndreds of thousands if not millions of year, long before humans started cultivating land for their own purposes. Through tilling the land, we have systematically broken up sub-surface networks of nutrients, structure and moisture - resulting in loss of fertility and erosion. Tilled land also releases soil carbon, making industrial agriculture a net emitter of carbon and a contributor to global warming.

Communities that are closer to the people and natural environments which provide sustenance are not only more resilient to the disruption of international supply chains but have stronger relationships locally that allow them to adapt to uncertainty in an agile way. Producers who already communicate regularly with their customer base have the infrastructure in place to respond to changes to their supply chains and reorganise quickly through effective communication and collaboration.

But what if we could transition back towards these practices in agriculture? There is a huge potential to rapidly start sequestering huge amounts of carbon into our soils with so many benefits. Healthy soils mean healthy and abundant food, better human and animal health and ultimately a healthier and more resilient planet. Given the neccesity to act now on climate change, widely adopting such a fundamental, ultimately simple tool in reversing the carbon cycle, we can transform the biodiversity of our planet and the resilience and quality of our food systems all at once.

So what is needed?

Policy

Finance

Education

Activism

## A climate perspective

Systematic depletion of soils is not only a food resilience and biodiversity issue. Global carbon emissions from agriculture continue to rise. We are all too aware of the urgent and radical need to curb our global emissions to manageable levels - as recognised by the Paris Agreement and the countries who have signed up to the pledge.

Yet there is a huge opporunity in shifting our priorities from a purely output focused treatement of soils to one that recognises it's carbon capture properties. Healthy soils, natural ecosystems are incredibly effective at sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. As clever technocrats debate new energy and resource intensive industrial schemes to suck carbon from our atmosphere, the solution has been beneath our feet all this time.

An ecosystem of living, varied organisms below and above the ground has huge benefits. Not only does it improve soil nutrient levels, structure and biodiversity it also speeds up chemical processes which ultimately boost the carbon cycle, storing atmospheric carbon in our soils.

This shift in perspective in agriculture has a positive knock-on effect for our climate issues. This integrated view is what makes this a particularly effective climate solution in my view. Another is the scale and speed at which these 'back to basics' techniques can be applied globally and to a range of farming businesses.

So what next once we recognise the need for action to shift in this direction?

## Innovation pipeline

There are many pitfalls and risks associated with developing technologies for new markets and sometimes this brings with it a certain _hype_ element which is not necessarily helpful.

A huge impact area is the ability to store carbon in our soils through vibrant, abundant ecosystems. There are major benefits to scaling this approach:

- **It already exists!**
  Natural systems are there to convert atmospheric carbon into soil nutrients through complex chemical processes
- **Available at scale!**
  Farmland already takes up a vast amount of our global land mass. Turning fields into intensive carbon sequestration plants through relatively low-tech appraches we can start to accelerate towards a net zero economy
- **Fair and diverse**
  Small-scale, mixed farms are very effective at producing food outputs - ultimately they have evolved during millenia. Embracing and protecting more traditional or even indigenous land-management practices means we can apply techniques without major disruption or delay.

My own personal interest however is exploring the role of technology tools and solutions in helping embrace these old/new approaches to producing our food in a sustainable, healthy and profitable way.

Clearly there is a contradiction between returning to more traditional practices and technological innovation - sometimes not the most sustainable from environmental perspectives.

Areas of agritech:

- information services - soil, crop health analysis made possible through direct data capture
- Automation and robotics - automate tasks or tools to complement existing processes
- Decision support tools - spotting trends in the data lanscape, helping us understand our actions and the effects they have on the system

## Engineer farmers or farmer engineers

As we start to see the slow emergence of our societies from a period of social and physical isolation, many of us are re-evaluating aspects of our society and economy - people want to **rethink** and **reimagine** instead of returning to **business as usual**. It's clear that we cannot continue on a path of infinite growth on a planet with finite resources. Or to put it another way, we need to redefine our notions of growth, towards something more circular instead of exponential.

In agricultural systems too, this shift in approach is long overdue. Industrialised food production has evolved over the last century to incentivise productivity and cost saving over environmental protection and biodiveristy. As supply chains become longer and more integrated with large corporate players, the industry focuses on the wrong outcomes - short-term gains over long-term gains of resilience and quality. Producers are being put in the unfair position of choosing between the economic viabiity of their business (and ultimately staying afloat) and their fundamental role of guardians and managers of our natural environment.

A global shock, like the Covid 19 pandemic was a fantastic opportunity to illustrate to many the precarious nature of our food systems. Supermarkets who operated just-in-time stock with international logistics were days away from empty shelves. Resilience in our food systems suddenly took on a very new meaning - illustrated by how disconnected we are from our food and the people who produce it.

It's a relatively recent development that food is being produced, transported, bought and consumed the way it is today. Technological advancements with new economic models and consumer behaviour in the 20th centry are partly behind this shift and so is agricultural policy.

Insutrial farming techniques - heavy mechanisation, chemical inputs such as fertilisers and pesticides and vast monocultures have been applied to eek out increasingly slim profit margins from crops that will ultimately compete on international markets. Meanwhile policies failed to prioritise soil health and biodiversity as an economic factor. We are now seeing soils depleted with the existing toolkit of chemical inputs no longer working - certainly not from a biodiversity perspective. There is now a recognition that a loss of vibrant ecosystems above and below the surface of the planet has a direct economic impact on productivity and resilience of our food systems. It follows then, that even the most cynical, profit-oriented corporation needs to start engaging with the reversal of some of the damaging trends of the last century. According to the UNs FAO agency, we only have 60 harvests left in our global soils if we continue at this rate (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-food-soil-farming-idUSKCN0JJ1R920141205).
