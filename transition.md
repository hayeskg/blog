# Transition - system change for regeneration

Like most years, I had the opportunity at the end of 2021 to visit Hungary - to see family and friends over the holidays. This year I wanted to meet more people working in and around agriculture - regenerating land, producing high quality and integrity foods and building communities. I'm interested in building technical solutions to ease the transition towards more ecologically sound practices and I want to spend time understanding the people I am shaping architectures for.

With this drive and a desire to make change on my mind I reached out to people and arranged visits during the at the end of the year and the beginning of the new one. Hanging out, learning about agriculture, soil, the region, seeing the countryside and spending time outdoors - all enjoyable, refreshing activities, not to mention the positive effect on shaping my understanding and thinking.

In this post I want to bring together some of what I saw, the thoughts they provoked, the conversations that happened. As I read and learn more about the theory and practice of regenerative agriculture, soil health and biodiversity, its importance in the systematic changes we must oversee in our food systems, the goal started to sink in. Before I can propose appropriate techical solutions to make young growers' lives easier, I really need to hear and understand what their fundamental probles are. It's essential not to fall into the age-old trap of engineering solutions to problems that don't exist and then validating them, but very much working from the other end of the spectrum.

## Why regenerative agriculture?

I've written a piece on a maturing engineers' view on regenerative agriculture - feel free to read it [here](https://hayeskg.medium.com/regenerative-agriculture-an-engineers-view-29cd86aa86b9). A few core concepts will be a helpful reminder for the context of this post:

- By building soil health and biodiversity the carbon cycle is transformed into locking away atmospheric CO2 below the surface of the planet. Regenerative agriculture therefore is at scale a truly global cimate change solution. As such, it is being recognised and financially incentivised by the wider economic community.
- Healthy soils are more productive - they require less inputs, retain water and are able to deliver nutrients more effectively to crops. Healthy soil is a fundamental component of nutritious, abundant, resilient food systems.
- Biodiversity above and below ground requires a shift in mindset from controlling nature to working within natural systems. Instead of applying fertiliser, herbicide, fungicide and nutrients - natural additives can harness existing systems to have the same or better results. A good example is introducing harmless fungal life which will take up the space that a counter-productive fungal 'disease' may exploit.

To an engineer like myself wishing to work within an infinitely complex system (**nature**) an acceptance is needed that not all parameters can be controlled - or even fully understood. It is therefore a better approach to observe patterns and interconnectedness - for which we can utilise modern data science - docmeunt them and learn more about these sophisticated network of systems. We can then affect change from within, rather than discarding the seemingly unnecessary _components_ that seemingly don't matter.

Perhaps most importantly I am interested in demonstrating to farmers who work in differnt, landscapes, climates and environments (market gardens, intesive grazing operations and arable farms) that transitioning towards more ecologically sound principles in their operations can be sustainable not only in the single sence of the word. Literature, research and a wider community are talking about theory, early practical examples and increasingly bold ventures at scaling these regenerative solutions around the globe for impact. Public and private finance is taking note - agricultural subsidies are moving towards ecosystem services-based payments while voluntary carbon markets are emerging as a way of accounting for soil organic carbon captures fron the atmosphere.

## Timing and geography

My personal angle means that geographically my refernces are Northwester Europe, the UK and Central and Eastern Europe. These regions are diverse enough to demonstrate the breadth and depth of solutions needed to support diverse agricultural models to adopt a more regenerative framework. Personal ties in both regions mean I am sensitive to wider cultural, social and economic differences that have an effect on agricultural businesses across the spectrum. In my career I have reached a stage where I am able to take the time and space to take a step back, evaluate and truly drill down to the core of what kind of change I wish to see in the world and how I may be able to contribute to it. We live in an age where young professionals are able to make a choice between purpose and profit or even to find an appropriate balance, this is privilige, progress and most certainly must be exploited.

The trip late last year intersected with a time of contemplation after 18 months of hard work at E-Nano. We have been busy developing robotics solutions that make use of open source software and hardware technologies, a distributed knowledgebase and lots of youthful energy to bring scalable, lightweight, working solutions to the world. This is a fulfilling, worthwhile and impactful role to be in. At the same time there is a desire to be true to core values and work towards a vision of the world we can imagine living in.

- Carpathian basin - fertile land
- land has changed hands throughout history - now increasingly moving into huge, consolidated farms
- European influence in strategy and markets
- Young entrepreneurs

## A young community

The below is a list of small organisations that are shaping the future of agriculture in the CEE region, either directly or by the proliferation of skills, ideas and shared understanding for a common cause. There was no greater feeling of achievement and satisfation than to combine these two areas of my life - personal and professional growth.

- Small biointensive market garden
  [Zsamboki Biokert](https://www.zsambokibiokert.hu/) is a compact organic market garden not far from Budapest. Its mission is to grow food in a natural way, while building community and safeguarding the land and boosting its biodiversity. The team grow tasty vegetables, build soil, engage with community and collaborate with academic institutions and NGOs. They sell produce at market and run a weekly box system, delivered via cargo bikes in the city.

- Grazing, uplands, agroforestry
  [Remeny Farm](https://www.remenyfarm.hu/) was started by an inspirational young couple who made a leap from city lifestyles. They produce high quality and integrity foods while regenerating land and market their produce through their own platform. Their vision of a profitable, worhwhile climate farming enterprise can serve as a blueprint for the next generation of farmers passionate about climate, nature and food.

- Larger arable land management, integrated services
  I met an old friend who is in the process of taking over a family agro-business. As the case for regenerative transition strengthens so can the influence through this network of knowledge, services and products. Form me, this scale is a real window into a different scale agricultural system in the region.

- An agtech startup from the region
  [SMAPP LAB](https://smapplab.com/) is a startup which is scaling rapidly in the region and internationally. They successfully completed programs to collaborate with large estates to solve problems at scale in agricultural systems. Their network of pest traps is an example of simple, low-impact technology deployed in a coordinated way can reduce our reliance on intesive, damaging practices in producing our food.

- Regen ag products and services
  [Agrofutura](https://www.agrofutura.hu/) is a business which provides products, machinery and consulting services to demonstrate the benefits of more ecologically sound practices in commercial agriculture. With high quality compost concentrates and an experienced agronomist team they help clients improve outcomes fast. It's great to see successful examples of regenerative practices deployed today.

- Startup accelerator NAK Techlab
  [NAK TechLab](https://www.naktechlab.hu/) is run by a public office for agriculture. Their TechLab offers a variety of services to early startups, including an incubator program, where they pair startups with real problems larger agricultural businesses have to ensure meaningful problems are being solved. They are able to support scaling through public and private investment opportunities, mentorship and network building.

## What next?

I continue to work and shape the organisation I've been helping to build over the past period. I continue to meet new people, talk about my interests and listen to new ideas. I continue to make new connections, design models and work on detail.

I urge everyone who is interested in this way of thinking to indulge in a bit of self-reflection. What aspects of my life can I change in order to shift patterns, transition towards more sustainable, fulfilling, stable systems? Can I engage more with community, the products and services I consume? How can my small actions contribute to a world I want to live in?
